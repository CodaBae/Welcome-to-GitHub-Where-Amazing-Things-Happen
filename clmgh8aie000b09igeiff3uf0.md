Hello, my fellow techies!

I'm thrilled to welcome you to my very first blog post. I'm Shalom Ijeoma Mathew, a creative software developer with a unique writing style. In this introductory blog, I'd like to share more about myself, my journey as a developer, and why I've chosen to teach technology through storytelling.

You might have come across my book on React on social media, and I've been overwhelmed by the positive responses so far. Many of you appreciated how I have been able to incorporate storytelling into my teachings.

But why have I used stories to teach?

It all started in my childhood. I loved reading storybooks as a kid. They transported me to magical places, fueled my imagination, and made learning an exciting adventure. However, when I entered the world of programming, things changed. Most tech books were filled with confusing jargon and complex language, making them seem nearly impossible to understand.

The difference between the storybooks I cherished and the tech books I studied got me thinking. What if I could combine storytelling with technology? What if I could make tech learning as enjoyable and accessible as those childhood stories? That's when the idea of teaching tech through storytelling dawned on me. Stories have the unique power of simplifying complex concepts and making them relatable. I figured that others thought about this like me, who would love to learn in this way.

My mission is to bridge the gap between technology and storytelling. I aim to make tech education not only informative but also enjoyable. Through my writing, I aspire to make learning technologies easier for everyone.

Whether you're seeking a fresh perspective or you're a beginner just starting, this blog is for you. I'll cover everything related to technology, from coding tips to the latest tech trends, all presented through the lens of storytelling.

As I embark on this journey of combining technology and stories, I invite you to join me. Let's explore technology together with stories as our guiding light. The question is, are you here to learn, find inspiration, or simply enjoy a good tech story? If yes, connect with me and get ready to be part of this new chapter in my journey.
